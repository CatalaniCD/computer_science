# C++

## About
* C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language
* Has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation
* Designed with an orientation toward systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.
* Useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).
* Almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.
* Standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally known as C++20).

## Philosophy

Throughout C++'s life, its development and evolution has been guided by a set of principles:

    1. It must be driven by actual problems and its features should be immediately useful in real world programs.
    2. Every feature should be implementable (with a reasonably obvious way to do so).
    3. Programmers should be free to pick their own programming style, and that style should be fully supported by C++.
    4. Allowing a useful feature is more important than preventing every possible misuse of C++.
    5. It should provide facilities for organising programs into separate, well-defined parts, 
      and provide facilities for combining separately developed parts.
    6. No implicit violations of the type system (but allow explicit violations; that is, those explicitly requested by the programmer).
    7. User-created types need to have the same support and performance as built-in types.
    8. Unused features should not negatively impact created executables (e.g. in lower performance).
    9. There should be no language beneath C++ (except assembly language).
    10. C++ should work alongside other existing programming languages, rather than fostering its own separate
      and incompatible programming environment.
    11. If the programmer's intent is unknown, allow the programmer to specify it by providing manual control.
