# Computer Simulation
Computer simulation is the process of mathematical modelling, performed on a computer, 
which is designed to predict the behaviour of, or the outcome of, a real-world or physical system.
The reliability of some mathematical models can be determined by comparing their results to 
the real-world outcomes they aim to predict. 
Computer simulations have become a useful tool for the mathematical modeling of many natural systems 
in physics (computational physics), astrophysics, climatology, chemistry, biology and 
manufacturing, as well as human systems in economics, psychology, social science, health care 
and engineering. simulation of a system is represented as the running of the system's model. 
It can be used to explore and gain new insights into new technology and to estimate the performance 
of systems too complex for analytical solutions.
