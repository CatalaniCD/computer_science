# Testing & Debugging 

## Software Testing

Software testing is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the software product or service under test. Software testing can also provide an objective, independent view of the software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation. Test techniques include the process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding failures, and verifying that the software product is fit for use.

Software testing involves the execution of a software component or system component to evaluate one or more properties of interest. In general, these properties indicate the extent to which the component or system under test:

    1. meets the requirements that guided its design and development,
    2. responds correctly to all kinds of inputs,
    3. performs its functions within an acceptable time,
    4. is sufficiently usable,
    5. can be installed and run in its intended environments
    6. achieves the general result its stakeholders desire.

## Debugging

In computer programming and software development, debugging is the process of finding and resolving bugs (defects or problems that prevent correct operation) within computer programs, software, or systems.
Debugging tactics can involve interactive debugging, control flow analysis, unit testing, integration testing, log file analysis, monitoring at the application or system level, memory dumps, and profiling. 
Many programming languages and software development tools also offer programs to aid in debugging, known as debuggers.
