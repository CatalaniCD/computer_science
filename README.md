# Computer Science

![alt text](https://github.com/CatalaniCD/computer_science/blob/main/c_s.png?raw=true)

Computer science is the study of algorithmic processes, computational machines and computation itself. As a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms, computation and information to the practical issues of implementing computational systems in hardware and software
